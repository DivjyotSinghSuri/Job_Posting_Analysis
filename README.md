# Business Analyst Job Postings Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes messy job posting data for **Business Analyst roles**. The main goals were:  
1. **Data Cleaning** – using Python (pandas, numpy, etc.) to transform the raw dataset into a structured format.  
2. **Data Analysis with SQL** – running queries to extract meaningful insights.  
3. **Visualization** – creating clear charts and graphs to highlight key findings.  

The project demonstrates how to go from unstructured data to actionable insights using a mix of **Python and SQL**.
